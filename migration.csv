"Footnotes:"
"The standard error indicates the uncertainty of the provisional migration estimate. For example, the 95 percent confidence interval is +/-1.96 standard errors."
"These intervals reflect the model uncertainty, not the extent of future revisions to provisional data. Standard errors are non-additive."
"Owing to rounding, individual figures may not sum to stated totals."
"Visa type is available from July 2003"
"The immigration visa type is that held or granted on arrival in New Zealand. People may change their visa type while still in New Zealand."
